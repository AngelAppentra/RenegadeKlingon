===============

Creating a love2d and lua based game just for fun, need to return back to arcade games. RenegadeKlingon is a r-type style game,
it is under construction now.

Download It
===========

You can try it for free, browse the code or report a bug using the issues. download it in:

https://github.com/AngelAppentra/RenegadeKlingonDeploy/archive/master.zip

For now its only for linux with love2d deploy system, a single .love file, to play the game you only need to download that zip file, uncompress it,
go to the directory linux and execute RenegadeKlingon.love with love2d.

If you don't know love2d check it at:

Install it and you will be able to play this game following the previous instructions.

sprites ...
